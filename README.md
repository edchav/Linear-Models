# Linear-Models

This repository contains custom implementations of linear models for regression and classification tasks applied to the iris dataset. 

# Requirements
1. Python
2. Numpy
3. scikit-learn
4. matplotlib
5. mlxtend

# Run the program
1. To execute the full pipeline (data prep, training, evaluation of for all models) run the main_script.py
2. Files can also be indivdually run in the following order that main_script is executes as well. 

# Folders and Files
The 'Data' folder contains the iris dataset split for training and testing. The 'Models' folder contains the different models for each 'train_classifer'/'train_regression' file. The 'Plots' folder contains the loss graphs and the decision boundary plots.
